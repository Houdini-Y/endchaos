# EndChaos

**The last recon tool you'll ever need.**

One command. Every endpoint. Full verb matrix. Crowdsourced intelligence.

```bash
endchaos uber.com --full --contribute
# → 187,432 endpoints with methods, tech, titles, interesting flags
# → automatically contributes to central database

## EndChaos combines:

	- All passive sources (Wayback, CommonCrawl, URLScan, OTX, Chaos, crt.sh)
	- Katana crawling + XHR/JS extraction
	- httpx with full verb testing
	- Kiterunner + aggressive bruteforce
	- Auto-detection of GraphQL, WebSocket, uploads, debug panels
	- Local cache + diff mode
	- Crowdsourced endpoint intelligence (opt-in)

This is the tool that ends the "8-hour recon" era.
